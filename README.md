1. Interface and reasons for choosing:
    *   Project interface - Web application
2. We decided to make it a web application, since quarantine measures against covid-19 are currently underway around the world. To access the library remotely, the web version of the project is the most suitable option for both users and librarians.

1. Programming language and database
*   Programming language:
    *   Backend part - PHP, Laravel
    *   Front end part - JS, Vue js
*   Database - Oracle database

Description:



*   We chose this stack for project implementations, since all projects within the university have the same stacks.
*   Database: University uses Oracle database
1. The database server works separately from the server where the project is deployed
    *   Database connections go through hostname / ip-address: port: sid using username, password, database name.
    *   Since the project is implemented on the Laravel framework, we use the ready-made yajra / oracle-oci8 library and php oci8 extension to connect to the Oracle database and build sql queries using the ORM built into the framework itself (Query builder, Eloquent builder)
